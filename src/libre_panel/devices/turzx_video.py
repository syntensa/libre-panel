"""Video mode for TURZX USB panels: frames go to the panel's H.264 decoder at up to 50 fps.

The panel has two layers: an H.264 stream (command 121) underneath and an
RGBA PNG (command 102) on top. The PNG path alone manages about 9 fps on
the 9.2", because the panel takes about 60 ms per full frame. The decoder has
no such limit. Libre Panel puts the whole frame into the video and keeps the
PNG layer transparent.

Everything here was measured on the 9.2" by the SPUR II project, which has
driven the panel this way around the clock at 50 fps
(docs/protocol/turzx-usb.md, "Video layer"):

- **Start:** ``110(name)`` clears the framebuffer (without it the screen
  stays black), ``111`` stops the local playback that 110 started, ``112``
  asks whether it still plays, then brightness, a transparent PNG layer, the
  player's rate (``15``) and the block size (``17``).
- **One picture per 121 block.** The panel's queue counts blocks, so a
  keyframe cut into three blocks looks like a queue of three.
- **Flow control:** ask for the queue depth (``122``) every second block;
  above 2, wait in 30 ms steps until it is at most 1. The queue is a ring of
  five blocks that silently overwrites unread ones, so flooding breaks the
  picture.
- **The player's rate** (``15``) is reported above the rate delivered: the
  player shows each picture strictly on its own clock and never catches up.
- **Stop:** ``123`` ends the stream, ``15 = 30`` gives the panel its power-on
  rate back (its own standby clip plays at the last rate set), and the last
  frame stays on the panel as a sharp PNG.
- **A hung decoder** takes each block only after about 750 ms and its queue
  stands high without moving. Detected as SPUR II does it (see
  :meth:`VideoSession.check_hang`). Nothing but a restart of the panel (11)
  or replugging clears it, so Libre Panel restarts the panel as SPUR II
  does: ``11``, wait until it leaves the bus (at most 20 s) and comes back
  (at most 90 s), 2 s more, then a full start with a new ffmpeg. At most
  three times in a row; after 300 s without a hang the count starts again.
  After that it asks to replug the panel.

This mode never sends commands that store anything on the panel: the start
sequence without 13 (save settings), 125 and 42 shows the video, and after a
power cycle the panel behaves exactly as before (measured on the 9.2").
The name sent with 110 stays in the panel's memory until it restarts.
